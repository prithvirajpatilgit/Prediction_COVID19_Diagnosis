### Aiming for a rapid and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19, this project utilizes effective screening models to reduce the burden on healthcare systems. The dataset, obtained from the 'ABC' government website, comprises 2,78,848 individuals who underwent the RT-PCR test. The dataset includes key features suspected to influence COVID-19 outcomes. The dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets, with a detailed breakdown of features.

## Features:-
•	Basic Information (ID, Sex, Age)
•	Symptoms (Cough, Fever, Sore Throat, Shortness of Breath, Headache)
•	Other Information (Known Contact with COVID-19)
•	COVID Report (Positive/Negative)

## Project Tasks:
1.	Perform feature engineering tasks.
2.	Apply data visualization techniques for pattern identification.
3.	Report characteristics of important features.
4.	Implement multiple machine learning models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, and others).
5.	Utilize cost functions to justify the model selection.

## Dataset: corona_tested_006

## Usage :-
1.	Clone the repository: Git clone :- https://github.com/RavinaKarnik/-Machine-Learning-Based-Prediction-of-COVID-19-Diagnosis-Using-Symptom-Data-
2.	Open the Files which is our dataset.
3.	Navigate to the respective reports to access the analysis and insights using Python Pandas and Numpy and for data visualization i am using Matplotlib and           seaborn.
4.	Customize the reports as per your requirements by modifying the data sources or adding additional calculations.
5.	I am using EDA and Feature Selection Processes for modifyting data.
6.	Analysis the report with the help of visualizing Google colab.
